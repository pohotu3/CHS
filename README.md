# This is a Beta Build!
We would like to thank you for taking the time to check out our brand new media
system! Finally we are able to annouce the Pi Beta Release, and we want your
feedback!

We have a bug report and feature addition page on our website! Check out
www.crystalhomesystems.com/report to access those forms. Frequent reports will be
added to our [FAQ](www.crystalhomesystems.com/faq) page as needed, so be sure to check that out before submitting a
report.

Crystal is built on the Raspberry Pi, and runs on Ubuntu Mate for the rPi2. The
software you downloaded will be able to flash directly to a SD card and plug into
your pi and run right out of the box! There are a couple of things to note before
you do that though.

* Our system runs off of Bluetooth services. This is because we needed a secure
system in place to prevent a 3rd party from slipping into the connection stream
and messing with your home. This also allows us to know for SURE that our devices
will stay running, even if your home network goes down. This is perfect for security
systems around your home.

* When you add a new Shard to your home, after you power it on the bluetooth will
turn on and broadcast itself to the world! To connect it to your Heart, simply go
to [INSERT WEB URL HERE TO ACCESS REMOTE SHARD PAGE]() and click on "Attach Shard",
and walk through the wizard.

#### Thank you for your interest and support!
