# This is a Beta Build!
We would like to thank you for taking the time to check out our brand new media
system! Finally we are able to annouce the Pi Beta Release, and we want your
feedback!

We have a bug report and feature addition page on our website! Check out
www.crystalhomesystems.com/report to access those forms. Frequent reports will be
added to our [FAQ](www.crystalhomesystems.com/faq) page as needed, so be sure to check that out before submitting a
report.

Crystal is built on the Raspberry Pi, and runs on Ubuntu Mate for the rPi2. The
software you downloaded will be able to flash directly to a SD card and plug into
your pi and run right out of the box! [Here is a full video tutorial on how to get your system running!]()

* When you add a new Shard to your home, after you power it on the WiFi will configure and connect, and it's almost ready
to use! To connect it to your Heart, simply go
to [INSERT WEB URL HERE TO ACCESS REMOTE SHARD PAGE]() and click on "Attach Shard",
and walk through the wizard.

#### Thank you for your interest and support!
