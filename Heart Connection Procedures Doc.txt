Here's how the heart handles connections through socket:

Hosts on it's own IP

Hosts on port 6976

accepts an incoming connection on the port

either:
sends (the first) Registration packet to client containing server GUID for authentication and the command key (ie "ok crystal")
or:
Declines and closes connection with an error packet (info in the packetString) because the heart's config isn't set up

waits for registration packet from shard that contains shard GUID. This allows the heart to identify per shard, with details such
	as location, name, type, etc (heart will not accept other data without this packet)

if:
heart recognizes the shard as a device that's been set up before, sends Handshake packet and it will be open to packet types (below)
else:
heart will not allow the shard to send commands until it's set up through the web API, replies to shard with an error packet with reason
	in the packetString

Available commands for shard from here:
Close Connection (no info required)
Command (requires packetString containing the command)

Heart closes the connection with a CloseConnection packet containing reason in packetString
