HomeSystem is a project that is created by Ezra and Austin. Open Source under
the General Public License, the goal of this project is to create an automated home 
environment with the goalof making life easier, more convenient, and more 
atuned to your own personal needs.

Each Shard will power one or more functions in your home. Completely voice
controlled, the goal is to create a virtual AI to manage your home "hands
free".

Centrally controlled by a server, each Shard will accept voice commands,
process them, and reply appropriately. The Shards will range from media control
systems, security systems, climate control, and eventually home networking and
computational control.

If trying to work with the SFML setup we have with our system, you must download
the latest version (currently 2.3) from <http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.3/>
and place the folder in the directory 'C:\'. Then, go to C:\SFML-2.3\bin and copy
the .dll files into the working directory of the repository if they are not already
present!
