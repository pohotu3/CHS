    			HomeSystem Project
========================================================================

HomeSystem is a project that is created by Ezra and Austin. Open Source, the
goal of this project is to create an automated home environment with the goal
of making life easier, more convenient, and more atuned to your own personal
needs.

Each Shard will power one or more functions in your home. Completely voice
controlled, the goal is to create a virtual AI to manage your home "hands
free".

Centrally controlled by a server, each Shard will accept voice commands,
process them, and reply appropriately. The Shards will range from media control
systems, security systems, climate control, and eventually home networking and
computational control.
