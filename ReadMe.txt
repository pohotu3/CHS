THIS IS A BETA BUILD!
______________________________________________________________________________

We would like to thank you for taking the time to check out our brand new media
system! Unfortunately it is currently only a desktop build, and it's in beta.

Here are some things that you should know before pushing a bug report or running
the software for the first time:

1) The config file and patch information currently stores to your C drive. This
is NOT ABLE TO BE CHANGED AT THIS TIME! The reason for this is complicated.
However, this does mean that if your C drive requires administrator access to
read or write, you are going to have several crashes occur! This bug has only
popped up in Windows 8 computers, and rarely. Please do not report this, we're
very aware!
2) When you are setting up the directories for media folders, you MUST select a
folder that contains media. This includes a folder that includes all the sub-
folders (such as artists) which contain the music. However, selecting something
like your C drive will result in a crash. This is also outlined in the first
time setup menu!
3) OCCASIONALLY, if the system is unable to find an available media file upon
play request, it WILL crash at the next command. If this occurs, please be
aware that we are working on it, but also PLEASE report it to us with all the
detail you can!

One last thing should be mentioned. When there is a patch available, currently
you will be directed to our download page to re-download and install. This is
hopefully going to change during the Beta, we need a large audience to test the
system, but for now please bear with us!

Thank you for your interest and support!
